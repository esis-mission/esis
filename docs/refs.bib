    abstract = "{The transmittance of dc magnetron-sputtered Mg thin films was measured in the 25–1300 eV spectral range. Freestanding Mg films protected with Al layers were characterized ex situ. Transmittance measurements were used to obtain the extinction coefficient k of Mg films. The obtained k values along with the data available in the literature, and with interpolations and extrapolations for the rest of the spectrum, were used to obtain the real part of the index of refraction n by the Kramers–Krönig analysis. Sum-rule tests indicated a good consistency of the data.}",

    abstract = "{Magnesium/silicon carbide (Mg/SiC) has the potential to be the best-performing reflective multilayer coating in the 25–80 nm wavelength region but suffers from Mg-related corrosion, an insidious problem which completely degrades reflectance. We have elucidated the origins and mechanisms of corrosion propagation within Mg/SiC multilayers. Based on our findings, we have demonstrated an efficient and simple-to-implement corrosion barrier for Mg/SiC multilayers. The barrier consists of nanometer-scale Mg and Al layers that intermix spontaneously to form a partially amorphous Al-Mg layer and is shown to prevent atmospheric corrosion while maintaining the unique combination of favorable Mg/SiC reflective properties.}",
